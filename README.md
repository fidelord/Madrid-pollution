# Madrid-pollution
The folder called "notebooks used for cleaning" contains the notebooks used to extract the pollution information for each station from the original dataset. In order to run the files contained in that folder you need to download the orignal dataset from kaggle and put the dataset in the same folder as the cleaning files
The original dataset can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/decide-soluciones/air-quality-madrid
